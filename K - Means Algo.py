# K - means  clustering is an unsupervised learining where k is constant
# No seperate process for training
# K means clustering uses clustering as the core concept

# Types of clustering
# 1. Exclusive -
# 2. Overlapping - Overaps and the data may be avalilable for two clusters
# 3. Hierarrchieal - 5 steps follwed and the resukt is produced

# To find k values we use
# 1. Elbow method
# 2. Purpose based method
#
# 1. Elbow method we use inertia (Refer photo 22/01)
# 2. Purpose based method uses our wish of K to cluster the data

# Process to form the cluster

# Initialization

# Cluster Assignment

# Move centroid

# Optimizaton - It is the process of repeating the Cluster assignment and move centroid untill the values become same
# and unable to move (Refer Photo for the problem solved)

# Convergence

# Example
# {2,3,4,10,11,12,20,25,30}
#
# m1=11 m2=25
#
# 11 - 2,3,4,10,12
# 25 - 20,30
#
# m1=6 m2=25
#
# 6 - 2,3,4,10,11,12
# 25 - 20,30
